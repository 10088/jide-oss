<h1><font face="Verdana">JIDE Common Layer </font> </h1>
<p><font face="Verdana">JIDE Common Layer is Swing component library built on 
top of Java/Swing. It is also the foundation of other component products from 
JIDE. This project has over 30 Swing components and over 100k lines of code. It 
greatly enhanced the default component set provided by Swing and allow 
developers to focus on business logic layer instead of making components.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">JIDE Common Layer was originally developed by JIDE 
Software developers as a foundation in order to build other more advanced 
components. In April of 2007, JIDE Software decided to open source this common 
layer so that more and more developers can leverage them instead of wasting time 
building them again. </font> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana">You can run a demo of all components from JIDE Common 
Layer from <a href="http://www.jidesoft.com/products/download.htm">here</a>. The 
first webstart link contains the demos for all components in JIDE Common Layer 
as well as the demos for all other JIDE components.</font></p>
