It is also the foundation of other component products from JIDE. This project has over 30 Swing components and over 100k lines of code. It greatly enhanced the default component set provided by Swing and allow developers to focus on business logic layer instead of making components.</font></p><p><font face="Verdana">JIDE Common Layer was originally developed by JIDE Software developers as a foundation in order to build other more advanced components. In April of 2007, JIDE Software decided to open source this common layer so that more and more developers can leverage them instead of wasting time building them again. </font></p><p><font face="Verdana">You can run a demo of all components from JIDE Common Layer from <a href="http://www.jidesoft.com/products/download.htm"><u><font color="#810081">here</font></u></a>.
