<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /><h1><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">JIDE Common Layer Open Source Project</font></h1><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>What is JIDE Common Layer?</strong></font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">JIDE Common Layer is Swing component library built on top of Java/Swing. It is also the foundation of other component products from JIDE. This project has over 30 Swing components and over 100k lines of code. It greatly enhanced the default component set provided by Swing and allow developers to focus on business logic layer instead of making components.</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">JIDE Common Layer was originally developed by JIDE Software developers as a foundation in order to build other more advanced components. In April of 2007, JIDE Software decided to open source this common layer so that more and more developers can leverage them instead of wasting time building them again. </font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For more information, please visit <a href="http://www.jidesoft.com/products/oss.htm">project home page</a> on JIDE Software website.</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Demos and Examples</strong></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You can run a demo of all components from JIDE Common Layer from <a href="http://www.jidesoft.com/products/download.htm">here</a>. The first webstart link contains the demos for all components in JIDE Common Layer (as well as demos for other JIDE components). There is no examples checked in to subversion. The reason is all our examples (as you can see from the webstart demo) are very well integrated into a demo framework which depends on other non-open source JIDE components. So all examples with source code are part of the evaluation package which can be downloaded after registration. You can find more information about the evaluation package <a href="http://www.jidesoft.com/products/download.htm#eval">here</a>.</font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Licenses</strong></font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">JIDE Common Layer is <strong>dual-licensed</strong>. The two licenses are <strong><a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt" target="_blank">GPL</a> </strong>with<strong> <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/license.html">classpath exception</a></strong> and <strong>free <a href="http://www.jidesoft.com/purchase/SLA.htm">commercial license</a></strong>. You can click on the links to see more information. The first license is the most widely used license among open source community. It is also the same license under which Java platform is open sourced. The second license is the original commercial license under which all other JIDE products are released, except it is free of charge in this case. We released under this license so that all existing paid JIDE customers don't have to switch to the open source license.</font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Contribution</strong></font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are very flexible in accepting contributions from you as long as your own the copyright of the contribution. If you found a bug in our code, or would like to add a new feature, or introduce a new component, please feel free to contract support@jidesoft.com so that we can give you the check-in permission to the source code repository. We will code review the contribution and commit them. We will reward frequent contributors with free developer license of JIDE commercial products. </font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Technical Support</strong></font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of main issues in open source project is the lack of technical support. To address this issue, here is our support policy: </font></p><ul><li><p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Documentation: All source codes are javadoc&rsquo;ed. A developer guide is provided to describe how to use each component. A lot of examples can be downloaded to show you how to use components and classes in JIDE Common Layer. </font></p></li><li><p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bug reports: We will have dedicated resource to work on the bugs based on the priority we decide. We also accept bug fixes from the community after reviewed by our staff. </font></p></li><li><p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Free community support: We provide a special <a href="http://www.jidesoft.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=18">forum</a> so that you can get help from other people in the community. In order to encourage community, we will give away JIDE Developer License for those who actively participate in the discussion. </font></p></li><li><p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Paid technical support: If you think it&rsquo;s critical to get the high quality support in a timely fashion, you can always purchase the Annual Maintenance Renewal for JIDE Common Layer. For those who purchased JIDE commercial products, technical support for JIDE Common Layer is always included. Here is the <a href="http://www.jidesoft.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=19">forum</a> for paid customers.</font></p></li></ul><p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>FAQ</strong></font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>1. Why do you choose dual-licensing? </strong></font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We want to find a license agreement that allows as many people to use this project as possible but still protects our copyright and commercial interests. None of the license agreement can satisfy both conditions by itself. GPL is used by a large percent of open source projects but proprietary projects are not allowed to use it. BSD, Apache or public domain license allows almost anybody to use the project but does not prevent other 3rd party taking our source code and commercially marketing their enhanced version to compete with our own commercial offer. That's why we decided to choose dual-licensing. For most open source projects, as long as GPL-compatible, you can choose the GPL license. For all commercial companies, you can choose the free commercial license as long as you follow the license agreement. </font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>2. If I modify your source code to fix a bug or add an enhancement, should I contribute the change back to you?</strong> </font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As a matter of fact, you must contribute the changes back to us either you choose GPL or free commercial license to comply with the license agreements. It is for your own benefit too because you don't want to maintain a different version of source code yourself which will cause trouble when you want to upgrade to a new version of JIDE. This is actually one reason we don't want to go with BSD or Apache license. Since the project is open sourced on https://jide-oss.dev.java.net/, you can easily use Subversion to check in the changes you made. You may need to ask us for the permission to check in. Our developers will review the changes ahd commit them. </font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>3. I have some cool Swing components I developed myself. I would like to open source it. Should I start a new project or should I contribute it to your project?</strong> </font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is totally up to you. If you decide to contribute it to us and we agree to accept those components, we will maintain them for you in the future, even you might grow out of it. But we do require you to give the copyright of the components to JIDE so that we can release them under the same license agreement as all other components in JIDE Common Layer. </font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>4. I am a paid JIDE customer. What does this open source project mean to me? </strong></font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pretty much business as usual. The JIDE Common Layer (the jide-common.jar) is free for all paid JIDE customers since its initial release. If you are making commercial products, the same commercial license agreement still applies. The only benefit I can think of is now you can see the source code of all the classes in jide-common.jar even you didn't purchase source code license from us. If you have any questions, please feel free to email sales@jidesoft.com.</font></p><p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Maven Repostory</strong></font></p><p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">JIDE Common Layer is synchrionized with the maven repository on java.net (since 2.1.3.02 release).
